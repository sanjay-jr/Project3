# Project3

In this Project, we're beefing up security and user management. We're encrypting those private keys in the database using a super-secret AES encryption method, making use of a key from the NOT_MY_KEY environment variable for an extra layer of security. Next, is the user registrations with a new users table in the database, storing user details and super-safe hashed passwords using the fancy Argon2 algorithm. To keep tabs on who's logging in, I've got an auth_logs table tracking authentication requests, noting down the request IP, timestamp, and user ID. I've also thrown in an optional rate limiter for the POST:/auth endpoint, keeping things cool at 10 requests per second and politely telling anyone trying to rush in with a 429 Too Many Requests status. After this project, your JWKS server will be a fortress of security with encrypted keys, user registrations, authentication logs, and a fancy rate limiter to boot! Dive in, and have fun.
